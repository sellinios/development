# Zeus Development Roadmap

## Completed âœ…
- Fixed pattern teaching system with direct database integration
- 161 patterns successfully loaded and working
- Security permissions updated for pattern learning
- Documentation created for pattern system

## Next Days Roadmap

### Day 1-2: Fix Ermis Session Management
**Priority: High**
- [ ] Fix the session initialization timeout in Zeus interpreter
- [ ] Implement proper session handling in Ermis routing
- [ ] Add session persistence and recovery
- [ ] Test Zeus CLI with proper session management

### Day 3-4: Improve Pattern Execution
**Priority: High**
- [ ] Fix safe_eval restrictions for string methods (.upper(), .lower())
- [ ] Add support for safe recursive patterns (factorial, fibonacci)
- [ ] Implement pattern caching for better performance
- [ ] Add pattern usage tracking and analytics

### Day 5-6: Enhanced Pattern Features
**Priority: Medium**
- [ ] Add pattern composition (patterns calling other patterns)
- [ ] Implement pattern versioning
- [ ] Add pattern categories and search functionality
- [ ] Create pattern testing framework

### Day 7-8: Zeus CLI Improvements
**Priority: Medium**
- [ ] Fix the main Zeus entry point timeout
- [ ] Add autocomplete for pattern names
- [ ] Implement pattern help system (show usage examples)
- [ ] Add pattern import/export functionality

### Day 9-10: System Integration
**Priority: Medium**
- [ ] Integrate patterns with Zeus natural language processing
- [ ] Add pattern learning from user interactions
- [ ] Implement pattern recommendation system
- [ ] Connect patterns with Athena's reasoning engine

### Week 2: Advanced Features
**Priority: Low**
- [ ] Visual pattern builder/editor
- [ ] Pattern debugging tools
- [ ] Performance optimization for complex patterns
- [ ] Multi-language pattern support
- [ ] Pattern marketplace/sharing system

## Known Issues to Address
1. **Ermis Timeout**: Session creation blocks Zeus interpreter initialization
2. **Safe Eval Limitations**: Some Python features restricted (attributes, recursion)
3. **Pattern Discovery**: No easy way to browse/search available patterns
4. **Error Messages**: Pattern execution errors need better user feedback

## Technical Debt
- Remove mock implementations in Ermis sender
- Proper async handling for message responses
- Consolidate pattern storage (currently split between memory and database)
- Add comprehensive test suite for patterns

## Future Vision
- Zeus as a fully teachable system that learns from usage
- Pattern-based programming paradigm
- Community-contributed pattern libraries
- AI-assisted pattern generation and optimization
